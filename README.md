## Pymaceuticals Study Overview

I've joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. I have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.


## Observations and Insights

1. The line plot displaying the Capomulin regimen on a particular mouse (Mouse b128) determines that with use of the Capomulin drug, the tumor volume has decreased over the length of the study.
2. There is a very strong positive correlation between average tumor volume and weight of the mice of .84.
3. The Capomulin and Ramicane drug regimens produced extremely similar results for Tumor Volume (mm3) as displayed in the Summary Statistics. In the bar chart, it can be seen that the number of mice tested under Capomulin and Ramicane were 230 and 228, respectively. Based on these results, a drug regimen of Ramicane is just as effective as a drug regimen of Capomulin at decreasing tumor volume.
